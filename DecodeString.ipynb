    "* The most time-consuming operation inside the loop is the string concatenation when a ']' is encountered. In the worst case, this can lead to concatenating the entire string so far, which can take O(n) time in that iteration. However, this doesn't happen for every character, and the total amount of work done for string concatenations across the entire function is still O(n) because each character is added to curr_string once and moved from curr_string to prev_string at most once.\n",
